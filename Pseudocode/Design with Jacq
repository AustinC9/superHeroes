CRAP Principles

Contrast Repition Alignment Proximty

Contrast type,size,texture
color contrast visually see the visuals
two shades of greay and red
communicate efffectively and clearly 
green and blue and red are in the same saturation levels
deepened the blue and lightened the red
color and type
overlayed types
and a weird color effect


Repitition
repeat colors, patterns, other elements
placing elemeents in the same location 
typeface hierarchy
coca cola repition for different sodas
dotted line vs solid line

same icon everywhere you look
same stroke weight no good
different weights would not look consistent


Alignment
visual left visual is aligned with the shape of the letter
purposefully break align to create focus
quote on the outside of the paragraph alignment
geometric alignments
bring focus and direction and allow breaks to the eye
visual center is slightly offset above geometrical center

proximty
grouping 
whitespace
always choose clear comms over a neat design
group similar elements and seperating unlike elements helps readibility
